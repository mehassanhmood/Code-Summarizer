# Code-Summarizer

## Overview
The codebase has been implemented to analyze Python source code and extract information from it, such as classes, methods, functions, docstrings, and imports. It can also find dependencies between modules based on imports and generate a flowchart of the codebase using Graphviz. Additionally, it provides a way to summarize the codebase using a local LLM and export its structure to a JSON file.

## Code Base
1. The codebase is a set of Python scripts that provide a comprehensive analysis pipeline for analyzing a software repository.
2. The purpose of this pipeline is to extract information from the source code, identify dependencies between modules, and summarize the codebase using a local LLM (Language Model). 
3. Additionally, it can generate a flowchart of the codebase and export its structure to a JSON file.
